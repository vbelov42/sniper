# SNiPER

The SNiPER is an open-source general purpose software framework for High Energy Physics data processing. It is dedicated for needs of rare-process search experiments, such as neutrino interactions, dark matter, double beta and other.

For more info please visit [the SNiPER home at GitHub](https://github.com/SNiPER-Framework).

## Prerequisities

Required packages:
* CMT (v1r26 or later) - configuration management environment, main build system;
* Compiler with C++11 support (GCC 4.8 or LLVM 3.4 or other);
* Boost (1.53 or later, with Boost.Python) - portable C++ source libraries, used for interface with python scripts;
* Python (2.7 or later) - interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language, used as main script engine for SNiPER modules.

Optional software:
* git (1.8 or later) - needed to get source code with repository;
* cmake (2.8 or later) - alternative build system;
* ROOT (5.18 or later) - needed for ROOT file I/O;
* Intel TBB - for parallel computing.

Note that in RHEL6 system (and derivatives) an old GCC 4.4.7 is used. To enable C++11 features, we recommend to use [devtoolset](http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/devtoolset/) packages, where GCC 4.8 or better are available.

## Build

### Using CMT

You need installed and working CMT environment. Also you'll need external packages Boost, Python (and ROOT) available under Externals/.

Get the source gode using `git clone https://github.com/SNiPER-Framework/sniper.git` or downloading a [ZIP file](https://github.com/SNiPER-Framework/sniper/archive/master.zip) from GitHub and extracting it.

Add source code directory to CMT path:

```
$ cd sniper
$ export CMTPROJECTPATH=`pwd`:$CMTPROJECTPATH
```

Actually build SNiPER:

```
$ cd SniperRelease/cmt
$ cmt br cmt config
$ source setup.sh
$ cmt br cmt make
```

### Using CMake

Get the source gode using `git clone https://github.com/SNiPER-Framework/sniper.git` or downloading a [ZIP file](https://github.com/SNiPER-Framework/sniper/archive/master.zip) from GitHub and extracting it.

Make build directory and change to it:

```
$ mkdir build && cd build
```

Run CMake to configure your build. You can change your settings with `ccmake` or other tools. CMake has powerful ability to find software, but if it fails to locate yours, you can help it by defining `<NAME>_DIR` variables. Also it can use available CMT environment for search. By default installation goes to `/usr/local`.

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_REFIX=<install_dir> ..
```

Then build and install the result. Default build agent is `make` and you can call it directly.

```
$ cmake --build . --target install
```

Your build is now installed to the directory you provided to CMake. For the best experience one needs to set the proper environment. This can be done with the help of shell script `share/sniper/setup.sh`, or, a modern solution, using an Environment Modules file `share/sniper/modulefiles/sniper`. Also provided is a CMT project that allows use of SNiPER in CMT environment.
